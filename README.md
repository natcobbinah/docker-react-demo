# Overview of Project

This project demos a production-grade workflow development process of a single **React** app with an **nginx server**, using **docker** for containerization, **AWS ElasticBeanStalk** to host docker container and with **Travis-CI** used for continuous integration and deployment, by performing unit tests, before the app gets deployed on AWS EBS docker instance.
